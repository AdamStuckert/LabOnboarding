## FUNDING

Here is a non-exhaustive source of potential funding for the lab. Please add to this as you find new opportunities!

## Undergrads

UH offers several internal grants, please try for them!

## Grad students

## Postdocs

## Lab as whole

Upper level grad students and postdocs: we can write a full NSF or NIH grant together. I will probably tap you for help reviewing/writing these eventually anyway so you might as well be proactive about this!
