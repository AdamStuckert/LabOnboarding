### Welcome to the lab!

First off--I'm glad you are here! First and foremost I want everyone in the lab to be happy and healthy humans first. Please prioritize a healthy work-life balance, and make sure that you are taking care of yourself. Spend time with family/friends, exercise, take breaks.

## Required training

General training can be found here:

IACUC training is through CITI, but [find directions here.](https://www.uh.edu/research/compliance/iacuc/education-and-training/)

EHS lab training: The lab safety training catalog can be found [here](https://uh.edu/ehs/commons/safety-training/catalog/). You will be required to take the [general lab safety training](https://ehlsa.cougarnet.uh.edu/EHSA/login?showtrainingregistration=yes), please note that you have to sign up for a zoom training session for this training.


## Cluster access

Please [request access to the Carya cluster](https://uh.edu/rcdc/getting-started/request-account.php) under my allocation. Then when you have access [read through these docs](https://uh.edu/rcdc/support-services/user-guide/) and the ones below it in the drop down menu. Please take some of [the training courses](https://hpedsi.uh.edu/education/training), especially 110 Intro to HPC unless you are already cluster and SLURM proficient. [Here is a good intro to SLURM](https://blog.ronin.cloud/slurm-intro/), which is what our clusters use for job maintenance and scheduling.

For code, please contact more senior lab members (including me!) for code. Eventually, there will be a common repository of code for the lab--but this does not yet exist.
