### Welcome to the lab!

First off--I'm glad you are here! First and foremost I want everyone in the lab to be happy and healthy humans first. Please prioritize a healthy work-life balance, and make sure that you are taking care of yourself. Spend time with family/friends, exercise, take breaks, pursue hobbies, and snuggle salamanders.

## General expectations for lab members

The lab is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, disability, gender identity, race, religion (or lack thereof), or sexual orientation. Respect for diversity of the human condition is a non-negotiable expectation in the lab.

My goal is to cultivate a group of curious minds to pursue education and knowledge that contribute to each other's growth. Lab members should be a participating member of the lab community. This means attending lab meetings, helping each other out with protocols/writing, etc. I don't have specific expectations for when you are present on campus because people have different internal clocks. I tend to be on campus 0915-1600. So those are the times I am most likely to be available to meet and assist you, and I would like you to overlap with those hours at least several hours a week.

## Required training

General training can be found here:

IACUC training is through CITI, but [find directions here.](https://www.uh.edu/research/compliance/iacuc/education-and-training/)

EHS lab training: The lab safety training catalog can be found [here](https://uh.edu/ehs/commons/safety-training/catalog/). You will be required to take the [general lab safety training](https://ehlsa.cougarnet.uh.edu/EHSA/login?showtrainingregistration=yes), please note that you have to sign up for a zoom training session for this training.


## Cluster access

Please [request access to the Carya cluster](https://uh.edu/rcdc/getting-started/request-account.php) under my allocation and select "bash" as the shell. Then when you have access [read through these docs](https://uh.edu/rcdc/support-services/user-guide/) and the ones below it in the drop down menu. Note that in order to access the clusters you will need to either be on the UHSecure WiFi network or on the [UH VPN](https://uh.edu/infotech/services/computing/networks/vpn/). 

Please take some of [the training courses](https://hpedsi.uh.edu/education/training), especially 110 Intro to HPC unless you are already cluster and SLURM proficient. [Here is a good intro to SLURM](https://blog.ronin.cloud/slurm-intro/), which is what our clusters use for job maintenance and scheduling.

Code: please contact more senior lab members (including me!) for code. Eventually, there will be a common repository of code for the lab--but this does not yet exist.

Software: use the command `module spider SOFTWARE` to see if the software you need is already installed on the cluster by the RCDC group. If not, I maintain some software in `/project/stuckert/software` and it is executable by the group. Finally, don't hesitate to install anaconda3 to maintain software (put it in your personal directory in project; that is `/project/stuckert/users/YOURUSERNAME`). It is a great resource.
