### Welcome to the lab!

First off--I'm glad you are here! First and foremost I want everyone in the lab to be happy and healthy humans first. Please prioritize a healthy work-life balance, and make sure that you are taking care of yourself. Spend time with family/friends, exercise, take breaks, pursue hobbies, and snuggle salamanders.

## General expectations for lab members

The lab is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, disability, gender identity, race, religion (or lack thereof), or sexual orientation. Respect for diversity of the human condition is a non-negotiable expectation in the lab.

My goal is to cultivate a group of curious minds to pursue education and knowledge that contribute to each other's growth. Lab members should be a participating member of the lab community. This means attending lab meetings, helping each other out with protocols/writing, etc. I don't have specific expectations for when you are present on campus because people have different internal clocks. I tend to be on campus 0915-1600. So those are the times I am most likely to be available to meet and assist you, and I would like you to overlap with those hours at least several hours a week.

## Required training

General training can be found here:

IACUC training is through CITI, but [find directions here.](https://www.uh.edu/research/compliance/iacuc/education-and-training/)

EHS lab training: The lab safety training catalog can be found [here](https://uh.edu/ehs/commons/safety-training/catalog/). You will be required to take the [general lab safety training](https://ehlsa.cougarnet.uh.edu/EHSA/login?showtrainingregistration=yes), please note that you have to sign up for a zoom training session for this training.


## Cluster access

Please [request access to the Carya cluster](https://uh.edu/rcdc/getting-started/request-account.php) under my allocation and select "bash" as the shell. Then when you have access [read through these docs](https://uh.edu/rcdc/support-services/user-guide/) and the ones below it in the drop down menu. Note that in order to access the clusters you will need to either be on the UHSecure WiFi network or on the [UH VPN](https://uh.edu/infotech/services/computing/networks/vpn/). 

Please take some of [the training courses](https://hpedsi.uh.edu/education/training), especially 110 Intro to HPC unless you are already cluster and SLURM proficient. [Here is a good intro to SLURM](https://blog.ronin.cloud/slurm-intro/), which is what our clusters use for job maintenance and scheduling.

Code: please contact more senior lab members (including me!) for code. Eventually, there will be a common repository of code for the lab--but this does not yet exist.

Software: use the command `module spider SOFTWARE` to see if the software you need is already installed on the cluster by the RCDC group. If not, I maintain some software in `/project/stuckert/software` and it is executable by the group. Finally, don't hesitate to install anaconda3 to maintain software (put it in your personal directory in project; that is `/project/stuckert/users/YOURUSERNAME`). It is a great resource.


## Sample storage

All samples must be stored in appropriate tubes (mostly this will be 2mL Eppendorfs or PCR tubes). These must be located within a box that is labelled with the year and your name. **ALL samples must have relevant metadata stored on the cluster and accessible to me** This will help maintain the provenance of samples and make it clear to whom they belong and what these samples are. Label boxes with the label maker. Label all tubes with marker. If samples are preserved in ethanol, provide an additional label written on paper and in *pencil* so it does not get wiped away by the alcohol. Each lab member will be assigned space in the freezers. Please don't move anyone else's samples.

Samples will stay in the lab freezers when folks move on, please know this upfront. Please also save samples in duplicate when possible. I will not use them unless we are in agreement. I am more than happy to send samples to you when you land a faculty job and are ready for additional work on these samples.

## Data storage

All data must be stored in **READ ONLY** format in our storage on the Carya cluster (note to Adam: add a mechanism and location for this on the cluster later). Your data will be in a subdirectory under your name. Please arrange your data so that each project is in its own directory with appropriate metadata (I will provide a document on this eventually). When all readsets are back from the core and have been QC'd they should be archived on NCBI/ENA and embargoed for maximum time frame (2-3 years).

I will purchase a sufficiently large external hard drive for you to take data with you (pending funds, but this should be feasible).

## Undergraduate students

Please get involved and be an active member. The best way to get the most out of your time in the lab is to be present and engaged. Consider pursuing specific research projects with students in the lab, and consider pursuing independent research. 

## Graduate students

At the beginning of your time with me, and every year thereafter, we will sit down to create our Development Plan for you. This will include short term goals and long term goals, and we will tailor your time in the lab to meet those goals. We will reassess at least annually. This is so I can effectively give you the tools/opportunities you need, but also so that we can keep you on track.

We will develop project ideas and your dissertation together. This is an iterative process, and it will change over time. I do not expect, or want, a fully formed perfect little project when you first pitch the idea to me. 

Read widely, find cool science, learn lots about biology.

Actively be thinking about what you want after graduation--and this will help when we reassess Development Plans.

General issues on money/pay: My understanding is that you are paid monthly and your first paycheck won't be until possibly October? If you are not paid on time **please tell me immediately**. Y'all will TA most semesters, but I'm hopeful that I can pull federal grants to pay for at least 1 year as an RA and for summer RAships so field seasons are less sticky. 

I want you to apply for funding *even if your project and salary are fully funded*. Writing proposals is a very strange art form, and it takes a lot of practice. Write grants a month before they are due so we can revise revise revise. They require multiple iterations to get to a good spot. I will provide repeated feedback on these.


## Postdocs

## A general note about letters of reference:

Please give me at least 2 weeks notice when asking for letters of reference, more lead time is better for the first letter I write for you. When you send the request, please tell me 1) what the reference is for 2) general details about the opportunity 3) when it is due. If I have not submitted the letter a week before the deadline, please remind me. And remind me again at 2 days and 1 day before the deadline. 

## Notable Lab Infrastructure

There is a mini-fridge and microwave for FOOD and DRINK only. This is likely to be in the front half of the lab. Please feel free to use these resources. Please also keep in mind that this is for our group so follow basic fridge etiquette (don't leave your food in there to mold, don't steal food, don't use all the space, etc). There is also a coffee pot, if you drink coffee please bring some in on occasion to replenish the supply.
