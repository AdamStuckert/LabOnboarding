## Wet lab 

The Stuckert lab wet lab space is in SR2 room 328B. This is a shared space, please be respectful of other lab members. If you will be using the wet lab space, ask Adam to order you a key.

General expectations:

* All appropriate training must be completed prior to working in the wet lab
* If a piece of equipment is acting strange or broken, notify Adam immediately. Things will break, no one will be in trouble (I guess unless they punt the equipment. Don't punt the equipment.).
* Label EVERYTHING. Every reagent. Every sample. When in doubt, label. We have a label maker, so this is actually quite fun.
* Keep a detailed lab notebook with everything you do, every sample you work with, and every measurement you take. This will stay in the lab when you leave, but you should scan it before leaving.
* Replace, refill, reorder: If you remove a shared item PUT IT BACK (e.g. parafilm, scissor, packing tape, tools, etc.). If you need it long term, leave a note in its place so people know where it went and how to contact you. If you use the last of something you know how to refill/replace, DO IT (e.g. tip boxes, kim wipes, gloves, paper towels, spray bottles, etc.). If you notice something is low (not gone!) that you do not know how to get/make more of, tell your mentor immediately. 
* Clean up. This includes putting everything away and wiping down your surfaces. If someone has to clean up after you before they can work, then you did not clean.
* Music is fine, as long as anyone else in the lab is ok with it, otherwise use headphones. Ask them first. 
* Turn off the lights when you leave


## Freezer space

Every lab member collecting samples should have their own drawers/racks in the -20 and -80 freezers. It is your responsibility to label every box in a way that we can identify projects, every tube to identify the sample, and every sample needs to be in spreadsheets in the lab google drive. No exceptions.
