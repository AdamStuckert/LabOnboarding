## FUNDING

Here is a non-exhaustive source of potential funding for the lab. Please add to this as you find new opportunities!

## Things we need to add:

Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute: various levels and opportunities!\
Smith fellows

## Undergrads

UH offers several internal grants, please try for them!

[Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowhip (SURF)](https://uh.edu/honors/undergraduate-research/our-programs/surf/): $4,000 scholarship for summer research\
[Provost's Undergraduate Research Scholarship Program (PURS)](https://uh.edu/honors/undergraduate-research/our-programs/purs/): $1,000 scholarship for a semester research project\
[Houston Early Research Experience (HERE)](https://uh.edu/honors/undergraduate-research/our-programs/here/): $1,000 scholarship for a two-week workshop intended to orient rising sophomore and junior undergraduates to the fundamentals of conducting research (typically mid-May).\
UH College Work Study: I have an open ad for frog care folks all the time. If you are eligible for college work study please let me know and apply.

## Grad students

[NSF Graduate Rearch Fellowship Program](https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2023/nsf23605/nsf23605.htm): A 3 year fellowship with a VERY nice salary of ~$37k. Incoming grad students, first years, and maybe second years are eligible. Please check the document.

## Postdocs

[NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowships in Biology (PRFB)](https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2023/nsf23620/nsf23620.htm): $60,000 salary per year + $20,000 training allowance for 3 years. I will ask all eligible postdocs to write at least one of these because they are great training and a good salary.\
[Burroughs Wellcome Fund POSTDOCTORAL DIVERSITY ENRICHMENT PROGRAM](https://www.bwfund.org/funding-opportunities/diversity-in-science/postdoctoral-enrichment-program/): $60,000 over three years to support the career development activities for underrepresented minority postdoctoral fellows (Note: check eligibility).

## Lab as whole

Upper level grad students and postdocs: we can write a full NSF or NIH grant together. I will probably tap you for help reviewing/writing these eventually anyway so you might as well be proactive about this!
