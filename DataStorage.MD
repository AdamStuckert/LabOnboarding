## Data storage

The Stuckert lab will take at minimum a two-pronged approach to storing genomic data. First, we will download and place data into our local repository on the Carya cluster. Students will download data, check md5sums, then deposit that data in the repo. I will then make the data read only. Metadata **must** be included in the directory with raw reads. These raw reads may be copied or read, but are to remain in their original unedited form in perpetuity. Raw reads will also be deposited in the Short Read Archive (SRA) with an embargo period of at least 2 years. Do this ASAP after checking md5sum values and placing data in the repository on the cluster.
