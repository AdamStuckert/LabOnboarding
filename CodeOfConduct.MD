## Code of Conduct

This code of conduct aims to generate a safe and equitable workspace. It will not create a problem-free workspace, but it outlines clear expectations as well as resources for communicating problems faced in the lab. This code of conduct, along with all other lab resources, will be continuously shaped by the Stuckert Lab team. If you have suggestions, don’t hesitate to reach out to astuckert@uh.edu or bring a point up at our next lab meeting. 

Misconduct: 
Lab members will not engage in discrimination, sexual discrimination or violence, harassment, bullying, dishonesty, fraud, misrepresentation, coercive manipulation, censorship, micro-aggressions (the everyday verbal, nonverbal, and environmental slights, snubs, or insults which communicate hostile, derogatory, or negative messages to target persons based solely upon their group membership) or other misconduct. This applies to conduct in work situations both on- and off-campus, and to both intentional and unintentional behavior. For further definition of misconduct, refer to [UH Student code of conduct](http://publications.uh.edu/content.php?catoid=47&navoid=17735).

Respect:
* Respect the ideas of others. Be cognizant to not interrupt, speak-over, or dismiss the ideas of others inside or outside the lab. Listening and leaving space is a skill that requires practice and we are here to practice together. 
* Respect the time of others​. Because the lab is member-run, if you are meeting others for training or carpooling, it is imperative that you are on time so that others are not waiting for you. If you’re running late, text or Slack ahead and let people know when you expect to arrive. This means you’ll need people’s numbers before you’re late.
* Respect yourself. Take breaks​! If you work for three hours or more, take a 15-minute break every 1.5-2 hours. If you’re doing intensive microscope, video, or counting work, rest your eyes every 20-30 minutes. Studies have shown that taking regular breaks makes you more productive. It’s also important to care for yourself. 
* Respect your own ideas! Take your ideas seriously​. Many of the lab tasks are for ongoing projects that we are beholden to community groups, grantors, or others for. But we are always interested in new projects or new ways of doing ongoing projects. We’re especially interested in ideas for how to make our work more equitable for all (e.g., unlearning colonialist habits, removing explicit and implicit bias against people or groups, reducing frivolous gatekeeping, improving equitability in access to science and knowledge). If you have an idea for something you want to explore or develop, let us know!

Lab Communication: 
Resolve conflicts when they are small​. Conflict resolution critical to group work. If you’re
having some trouble with a rule, a process, a person, etc., others may not notice and it’s up to you to articulate the issue so we can address it. You can say things like, “I notice that you’re late sometimes, and then I have to use my time to wait for you when I’d prefer to work at our agreed upon time. How can we work on that?” or “Thank you for volunteering to make the map! I appreciate that. But we want to give everyone a chance to practice map skills, so we’re going to have Sandrine do it this time. How does that sound?” 

Report misconduct. Contractors have a responsibility to appropriately and promptly report misconduct they witness or of which they become aware as related to their contracted work. When working in off-campus locations, contractors should report according to practices of the workplace they are operating in. When the misconduct involves UH affiliated persons, lab members should report to Molly or to upper admin (Amy Sater or Erin Kelleher). 

If you have to go, go. But tell us​! Sometimes the semester is overwhelming, life
happens, and you either need to take a break for a few weeks or leave the lab altogether. That’s
normal and we will look to support you in that. Just make sure you let Molly know so she can
ensure your project is cared for in your absence.

Science Communication:
Acknowledge the shoulders you stand on​. When writing articles, giving presentations, or communicating your science, please acknowledge the community resources, knowledge, and hard work that brought about your exciting science. No scientific discovery is made by one person, one experiment, or even one lifetime of work. 

Cite marginalized voices​. Be aware of your reference biases. Too often women, people of color, people from the Global South, and others that are left out of science. This is called citational politics: most bibliographies are mainly white men, which perpetuates the idea that science and knowledge are by and for white men. This is one place to change that. We can change how value is accrued in science and academia through our citation practices.

Responsible communication on social media. We support you sharing your science and social media is one medium for science communication. Please be cognizant of others' feelings and the fact that there is a diversity of opinions and experiences among us. 

Shared Values:
The Stuckert Lab shares a core set of shared values - assume goodwill, kind honesty, bravery, inclusion, engagement, excitement for research, respect for your limits, and respect for all working styles. And we are excited to share a space that promotes each other, our science, and these values.
