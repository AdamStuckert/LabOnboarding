## FUNDING

Funding is really important! This is probably no surprise. Even if the lab is well funded I expect us to be trying for new sources of funding. The reasons are twofold: 1) It looks really good for you if you are able to secure independent funding and 2) It takes several tries to land a grant so trying early and often is critical.

Here is a non-exhaustive source of potential funding for the lab. Please add to this as you find new opportunities!

## Opportunities for folks at all levels:
[Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute (STRI)](https://stri.si.edu/academic-programs) has fellowships/internships for any level, check them out!
SSAR
ASIH
SIGMA XI
GENETICS SOCIETY CONTINUING PROJECT....


## Undergrads

UH offers several internal grants, please try for them!

* [Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowhip (SURF)](https://uh.edu/honors/undergraduate-research/our-programs/surf/): $4,000 scholarship for summer research
* [Provost's Undergraduate Research Scholarship Program (PURS)](https://uh.edu/honors/undergraduate-research/our-programs/purs/): $1,000 scholarship for a semester research project
* [Houston Early Research Experience (HERE)](https://uh.edu/honors/undergraduate-research/our-programs/here/): $1,000 scholarship for a two-week workshop intended to orient rising sophomore and junior undergraduates to the fundamentals of conducting research (typically mid-May).
* UH College Work Study: I have an open ad for frog care folks all the time. If you are eligible for college work study please let me know and apply.

External grants:

* [STRI RaMP-UP](https://www.gsscholar.org/rampup-fellows-program): A paid, year-long research experience at STRI in Panama. Open to recent and soon to be graduates. 

## Grad students

* [NSF Graduate Rearch Fellowship Program](https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2023/nsf23605/nsf23605.htm): A 3 year fellowship with a VERY nice salary of ~$37k. Incoming grad students, first years, and maybe second years are eligible. Please check the document. [Some examples of funded GRFPs can be found here](https://github.com/ybrandvain/GRFP) and [here is a nice writeup about the GRFP with tips!](https://www.alexhunterlang.com/nsf-fellowship)
* [Am Nat student research awards](https://www.amnat.org/announcements/apply-student-research-award.html#:~:text=The%20ASN%20Student%20Research%20Awards,%242%2C000%20check%20to%20the%20candidate): $2,000 for students post-candidacy; due in March.
* [Explorer's Club Exploration Fund Grants](https://www.explorers.org/grants/the-exploration-fund-grant/#form_explorers): $2,500-5,000 for exploratory research due September 13, 2024, 6:00 PM EST
* [Mohamed bin Zayed Species Conservation Fund](https://www.speciesconservation.org/grants/): The Fund has been established to provide targeted grants to individual species conservation initiatives, recognize leaders in the field and elevate the importance of species in the broader conservation debate. Its focus is global and eligibility for grants will extend to all plant, animal and fungi species conservation efforts, without discrimination on the basis of region or selected species. However, it is very competitive indeed with only around 12% of applicants receiving a grant. Three cycles per year, and up to $25,000.

## Postdocs

* [NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowships in Biology (PRFB)](https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2023/nsf23620/nsf23620.htm): $60,000 salary per year + $20,000 training allowance for 3 years. I will ask all eligible postdocs to write at least one of these because they are great training and a good salary.
* [Burroughs Wellcome Fund POSTDOCTORAL DIVERSITY ENRICHMENT PROGRAM](https://www.bwfund.org/funding-opportunities/diversity-in-science/postdoctoral-enrichment-program/): $60,000 over three years to support the career development activities for underrepresented minority postdoctoral fellows (Note: check eligibility).
* [Smith Fellowship](https://conbio.org/mini-sites/smith-fellows/about-the-program/program-details/): Two year annual salary of $65,000, research funds totaling $32,000 and an $8,000 travel budget to address a pressing conservatione need.
* [Hannah H Gray Fellows Program](https://www.hhmi.org/programs/hanna-h-gray-fellows-program#Overview): 
* [Explorer's Club Exploration Fund Grants](https://www.explorers.org/grants/the-exploration-fund-grant/#form_explorers): $2,500-5,000 for exploratory research due September 13, 2024, 6:00 PM EST
* [Mohamed bin Zayed Species Conservation Fund](https://www.speciesconservation.org/grants/): The Fund has been established to provide targeted grants to individual species conservation initiatives, recognize leaders in the field and elevate the importance of species in the broader conservation debate. Its focus is global and eligibility for grants will extend to all plant, animal and fungi species conservation efforts, without discrimination on the basis of region or selected species. However, it is very competitive indeed with only around 12% of applicants receiving a grant. Three cycles per year, and up to $25,000.

Upper level grad students and postdocs: we can write a full NSF or NIH grant together. I will probably tap you for help reviewing/writing these eventually anyway so you might as well be proactive about this!
